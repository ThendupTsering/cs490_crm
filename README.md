Get yourself some ruby and some rails!
Then you can run CRM 2000!

### Potential TODO ###

* Customer Acquisition?
  * List customers with no prior tickets or purchases
  * calculate which demographics have been most profitable?

* Customer Retention
  * sort customers by least recent interaction
  * sort unresolved tickets by least recent
  * sort customers using rfm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(customer_value))

* Customer Termination
  * mark customers as unprofitable, difficult, or uncoorperative
  * terminated customers won't show up in other lists by default
